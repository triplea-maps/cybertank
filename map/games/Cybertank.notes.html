<h2>Introducing the Cybertank</h2>
<p>
<p>The NorAm have built two prototype cybertanks, called Mk 1s.  These are already powerful units and the implication is that they will build more and larger ones, totally dominating the area. </p>

<p>The MidEast factions and the Russia have decided, seperately, that fast attacks will destroy the ability of NorAm to produce the new weapons.  This action quickly dissolves into general war. </p>

<p>Cybertank is a 4 player game with no alliances.</p>
